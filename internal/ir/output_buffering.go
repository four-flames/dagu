// in distributed mode. In local mode, "line" and "none" write directly without
// Go-level buffering.

	// This mode is best for interactive CLI tools and real-time log streaming

	// newline is kept in the buffer until either a newline arrives or the writer
	// is closed.

	// immediately. Use with caution in distributed mode — this may generate
	// excessive gRPC messages and increase overhead. Best for short-running
	// commands where latency is critical.
